<h2 id="details">Details</h2>

<p><em>An app where programmers can go off lone and program code to be sold,</em>
<em>or for hungry users to buy programs or even collaborate on huge projects</em>
<em>together in teams.</em></p>

<h2 id="how-to-download">How to download</h2>

<p><em>When Ka-Chain is finished, it will be placed into the Google Play Store.</em>
<em>There will be an initial fee to purchase app, for getting a proprietry</em>
<em>license for your programs. After purchasing, the app will be downloaded</em>
<em>and you can use it to create or buy programs after creating an account.</em></p>

<h2 id="creating-an-account">Creating an account</h2>

<p><em>Creation of account is necessary and the app will exit if</em>
<em>cancelled. Your account is needed to verify your identity and for</em>
<em>other users to recognise you as the programmer of an app they might buy</em>
<em>To create your account, you will need a phone number, an email, and a bank</em>
<em>account (for bills and payments). A verification message will be sent, via</em>
<em>both your email and number (both are required for security) and a request of</em>
<em>your balance of your bank account will be asked for, to verify that as well</em>
<em>After all that, you can purchase apps from other users, or sell apps, using</em>
<strong>Koins</strong></p>

<h2 id="koins">Koins</h2>

<h3 id="purchasing-them">Purchasing them</h3>

<p><em>Purchasing Koins are very easy, simply open up your accounts page and</em>
<em>scroll down to <strong>balance</strong> and click it. A page will open up containing</em>
<em>details about your balance in Ka-Chain, your exchange rate, and a balance</em>
<em> - possible if exchanged at that moment - in British Pound Sterlings, etc. In the section about Koins, you will see a tab</em>
<em>that says <strong>purchase</strong>, click on it and you can specify an amount. After</em>
<em>that, you will need to verify your bank purchase and accept and you will</em>
<em>recieve the amount of Koins you specified, however, it will only become</em>
<em>usable after the purchase has left the pending status on your bank account</em></p>

<h3 id="converting-them-back">Converting them back</h3>

<p><em>You should already know how to purchase Koins, converting them is just as easy,</em>
<em>simply open up your accounts page and scroll down to <strong>balance</strong> and click</em>
<em>it. A page will open up containing details about your balance in Ka-Chain,</em>
<em>your exchange rate, and balance- possible if exchanged at that moment - in British Pound</em>
<em>Sterlings, etc. In the section about</em>
<em>Koins, you will see a tab that says <strong>convert</strong>, click on it and you can</em>
<em>specify an amount - in the range that you own. After that, you will need to</em>
<em>verify your conversion with the global exchange rate and after accepting</em>
<em>you will recieve the amount of money (in pounds) you specified.</em></p>
